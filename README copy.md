  ## Description

 Rubbish Rumble is a one-player game where the user can create and name the characters created by giving them an avatar and by selecting a battle advantage. The user's characters will battle a unique database of opponent characters. This app allows to save characters and assign those characters according to users. Users are able to log back in and see the characters they had previously created. 

 For this project we used Node and Express server, and index.js as the template engine. Rubbish Rumble is backed by a MySQL database. We utilized animate.css as the new package we have not used before. Utilized CRUD routes for retrieving and adding new data. Our app is deployed using Heroku (with data). The folder structure meets the MVC paradigm.
